**Thinking Differently About a11y – Accessible Website Design for the Neurospicy**
> Did you know that approximately 1 in 7 people are neurodivergent? Within that group there is an entire spectrum of people whose brains process information differently. However, as frontend engineers we often forget to take these idiosyncrasies into account, or choose to simply apply industry standards such as WCAG 2.1 AA without digging deeper. In this talk, Steph shares some of the ways you can create better web experiences for the neurodivergent.

#### Halfstack on the Shore(ditch) - November 2022

**Are memes a design system?**
> Design systems are everywhere nowadays. It seems like everyone has one, from tech giants to scrappy startups, all with evocative names such as "Carbon", "Lightning" and "US Government Web Design System". But what even is a design system? If you've ever asked that question, the answer you heard was probably packed full of industry buzzwords such as "a shared visual language" that "tells your brand's story", and "a single source of truth" that "reduces redundancy", whatever that means.
In this talk, Steph cuts through the BS by critically examining the definition of design systems via the medium of memes, with the hope that by exploring the merits and flaws of defining memes as a type of design system, we might come that bit closer to understanding the true essence of what a design system actually is.
